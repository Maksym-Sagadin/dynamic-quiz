##### Used a JSON obect to dynamically populate a simple HTML page to make a quiz while using CSS to style it and javascript and DOM manipulation to alter the HTML contents.
###### By dynamically populating the HTML contents, it allows for us to make the quiz scalable by changing the questions or adding additional questions by altering the JSON object.
